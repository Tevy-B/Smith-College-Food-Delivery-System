Tested on MAC OS and Window.  Abstract: In this project, we will be creating a rough version of a GrubHub app, similar to the ones that Smithies have used this semester. A user can view a menu of all food options from a menu file. They can then choose a meal from the item, and receive a receipt containing all usersâ€™ inputs. A user also has the option to cancel an order. The receipt file can be reorganized and filtered.   There are two classes of objects (besides the main class): the Person, who orders a meal at a certain time, and the Meal, which contains all the food attributes, like drinks, desserts, side dishes, and main meal.  All of these operations are sorted in a series of menus, using objects, arrays, and lists.
